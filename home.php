                    <h4>Photo Editing Basic</h4>
                    <p>We see digital image files every day in a wide range of places. Whenever you see a picture on a computer or smartphone, you're looking at a digital image file. When you take a picture with a digital camera, you're saving it as an image
                        file. Even the images you see offline, like those in newspapers and magazines, probably started as digital image files before they were printed. Have you ever thought about how image files actually work? Here are some of the basics.
                    </p>


                    <div class="basic-list">
                        <ul class="basic-edit">
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-8">

                                        <h5>Pixel</h5>
                                        <p>Every digital photo is made up of pixels, often abbreviated as px. You can think of a pixel as a tiny square that uses a specific color. When you look at an image file on a computer, you're really looking at thousands
                                            and thousands of pixels. But because each pixel is so small, you normally won't notice each of them unless you zoom in.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </div>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-8">

                                        <h5>Dimention</h5>
                                        <p>When you refer to the height and width of an image, you're talking about its dimensions. For example, if an image is 500 pixels wide and 200 pixels high, you could say that its dimensions are 500px by 200px (the
                                            width is usually listed first). Let's look at a few other examples. The image below is 450px by 300px. Because this image is wider than it is tall, it's using a landscape orientation.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-md-4"><img src="images/dimention.jpg">
                                </div>

                                        <h5>Resolution</h5>
                                        <p>You can think of an image's resolution as the amount of detail contained in the image. The higher the resolution, the more quality the image will have. Resolution is especially important if you're thinking of printing
                                            or resizing an image. This is because you can generally make an image smaller without noticing much of a difference in the quality. However, making an image larger than its original size will usually result
                                            in a noticeable loss in quality.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>Once you’ve imported your video clips and they’re safely housed on your device, it’s time to organize them. Make a folder for your project with a subfolder for all the raw, unedited files you’ve just transferred
                                            across. Organization will pay you back in time saved. Don’t forget to name your files, so you can recognize the sequence you’re hoping to create. At this stage it’s also handy to delete your unwanted takes;
                                            keep only the best version of each shot to save yourself time in cutting these down the line. Be ruthless! A range of factors such as poor camera angles, quality of audio and delivery of any speech can throw
                                            your project off.</p>

                                        <p>All good videos have background music; awkward silences should definitely not make it to your small-screen project, unless they’re intended to build suspense. Make sure you’re using royalty-free background music
                                            to avoid any copyright issues later down the line (another great time-saving tip).

                                            you need for your chosen platform. No matter the platform you use to create your animation - for example, Adobe Photoshop - it will have specific instructions on how to render your animation and export for video,
                                            so it’s important you research within your specific platform.</p>

                                            exporting, along with its own set of video exporting settings. You’ll dictate the video format to export to and the presets, such as the bitrate of your video, which tells the software the level quality you
                                            want to export your video in.</p>
